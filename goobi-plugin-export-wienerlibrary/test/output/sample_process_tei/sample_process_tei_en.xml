                        Nazi concentration camp on the Ettersberg, ten
                        kilometres north west of Weimar, Germany, opened
                        in July 1937; most of the early inmates were
                        political prisoners; however, in the aftermath
                        of the November Pogrom in November 1938, German
                        SS and police sent almost 10,000 Jews to
                        Buchenwald; 600 prisoners died there between
                        November 1938 and February 1939.

            <p>It was 5 o’clock in the morning. To the left and right of
                the platform police officers were standing with weapons
                at the ready. We were met by SS. There was a hail of
                kicks and blows from rifle butts. We had to stand in the
                platform tunnel facing the wall and it was announced,
                “You are prisoners of the concentration camp and anyone
                who moves will be shot.” Then we were loaded onto
                lorries that were standing ready, and again it was said
                that anyone who dared to even move their head would be
                shot by the armed guard standing at the back of the
                lorry. The journey lasted c. 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>We could see nothing of the region we were driving
                through.</p>
            <p>Here too at the entrance we were again met by SS guards
                with weapons under their arms. As old people could not
                keep up, the SS helped them along with rifle butts. We
                went through the camp gate, over which stood a slogan,
                “Recht oder Unrecht – mein Vaterland” [My country –
                right or wrong]. We had to strip naked, even though it
                was cold and wet. Then we dressed in prison uniform.
                Then our heads were shaved like the commonest criminal;
                after that we had to report for duty and do military
                drills, from which as early as this there were the first
                deaths, because many elderly men suffering from heart
                disease could not keep up this pace. It was like this
                for the first and second day, without a break and
                without any food.</p>
            <p>We first received something to eat on the third day,
                namely half a litre of warm food and a two-kilo loaf of
                bread between five men. On the fourth day the prisoners
                were divided up for work. The Jews were used for the
                heaviest work. They went to the so-called quarry.</p>
            <p>
                The day was divided up as follows: half past 3 wake up,
                then acorn coffee, at half past 4

                These gentlemen drove us with a club, under the

                every gang at 5 o’clock in the morning. The Herr

                and SS guards were responsible for the workload being
                maintained, which naturally was particularly difficult
                with the diet and unfamiliarity of the physical work.
                Thus every day various people were left lying dead.
                Shooting at so-called living targets was popular, in
                other words if a worker did not comply he was chased
                across the so-called cordon, then of course he was “

            <p>The camp itself was surrounded by an electrified barbed
                wire fence, with a tower with machine gun posts every 50
                metres. By day in addition to this there was another

                 announced that the haulage gangs from the quarry, which
                had carried everything using four (men) with a litter on
                their shoulders until the beginning of June 1938, now
                had to carry the same and more using two. This of course
                was no longer carried on the shoulders but in both
                hands; however people now went down like flies as it was
                not permitted to take a break whilst working. The
                strength in the hands fails very quickly if c. two to
                three hundredweight have to be carried by two men a
                distance of two to three kilometres, and the result was
                that people did not comply and of course were considered
                to be Arbeitsscheue and refusers and were punished
                accordingly. I will come back later to the details of
                these punishments. In order not to fall foul of these
                measures, people tied their hands to the litters with
                rope in order not to attract attention, and preferred to
                let their hands be pulled out. When we had unloaded we
                had to return to the workplace or loading bay at the
                double. I myself sustained a hernia and torn lung
                through this inhuman work. As the food was only
                inadequate, strength very quickly ebbed away, and many
                died from exhaustion. There was no aid. People were so

                after work 30% of all the prisoners collapsed with
                exhaustion. These people were made to stand up again by
                means of cudgels, or they were dead.
            </p>
            <p>Incidentally in the camp we had to sign to say that we
                are Arbeitsscheue Jews and that we have signed this

            <p>Now I come to a chapter, this is the so-called house

                also seen and experienced these could believe that they
                had been transported back to the most gruesome dark
                ages, but it has to be accepted that back then it was
                not as bad.</p>
            <p>First of all there was corporal punishment for the

                the body was hung 10 cm. off the ground, legs tied
